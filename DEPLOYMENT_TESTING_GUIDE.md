# Budgex Plugin - Deployment Testing Guide

## Fixes Applied

### 1. URL Routing Fix
**File:** `public/class-budgex-public.php` (line 81)
**Issue:** JavaScript configuration used `/budgex-budget/` while WordPress rewrite rules expected `/budgex/budget/`
**Fix:** Changed `'budget_url' => home_url('/budgex-budget/')` to `'budget_url' => home_url('/budgex/budget/')`

### 2. Budget Calculation Fixes
**File:** `includes/class-budget-calculator.php` (calculate_remaining_budget method)
**Issue:** Incorrect method call `calculate_total_budget()` instead of `calculate_total_budget_with_adjustments()`
**Fix:** Updated method call and parameter order

**File:** `includes/class-database.php` (get_current_balance method)
**Issue:** Incorrect method call and parameter passing for budget calculations
**Fix:** Updated to use correct method with proper parameters

## Pre-Deployment Validation âœ…
- [x] All PHP files pass syntax validation
- [x] Method signatures verified
- [x] Parameter passing corrected
- [x] Test scripts created and validated

## WordPress Deployment Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
1. Backup your WordPress site and database
2. Upload the fixed plugin files to your WordPress installation
3. Ensure the plugin is activated

### URL Routing Tests
1. Navigate to the Budgex dashboard
2. Click on any budget in the list
3. **Expected:** Should navigate correctly to `/budgex/budget/[budget-id]`
4. **Previously:** Would fail with 404 or incorrect routing

### Budget Calculation Tests
1. Create a new budget with:
   - Start date in the past (e.g., 3 months ago)
   - Monthly budget amount (e.g., $1000)
   - Some additional budget adjustments
2. Add some transactions/outcomes to the budget
3. View the budget details page
4. **Expected:** 
   - Total budget should correctly calculate from start date to current date
   - Remaining budget should be accurate (total - spent)
   - No PHP errors in logs

### Dashboard Navigation Tests
1. From dashboard, click "View Details" on any budget
2. Use browser back button to return to dashboard
3. Try direct URL access to budget pages
4. **Expected:** All navigation should work smoothly

### Error Monitoring
- Check WordPress error logs during testing
- Look for any PHP fatal errors or warnings
- Monitor browser console for JavaScript errors

## Rollback Plan
If issues are found:
1. Restore the original plugin files from backup
2. Report specific errors encountered
3. Test environment details (WordPress version, PHP version, etc.)
